    <h1>CSS Layout - The position Property</h1>
    <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed,
        absolute or sticky)</p>

    <h4>The position Property</h4>
    <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
    <p>There are five different position values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>static</li>
        <li>relative</li>
        <li>fixed</li>
        <li>absolute</li>
        <li>sticky</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Element are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not
        work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>position: static;</h4>
    <p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.</p>
    <p>Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
    <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the
        normal flow of the page:</p>
    <p><u>exp.</u> position: static;</p>

    <div class="static">
        This div element has position: static;
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>position: relative;</h4>
    <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
    <p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relative-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted
        away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
    <p><u>exp.</u> position: relative;
        left: 30px;</p>

    <div class="relative">
        This div element has position: relative;
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>position: fixed;</h4>
    <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays on the same
        place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the
        element.</p>

    <p>A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>

    <p style="background-color: yellow;">Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:</p>

    <p><u>exp.</u> div.fixed {
        position: fixed;
        bottom: 0;
        right: 0;
        width: 300px;</p>

    <div class="fixed">
        This div element has position: fixed;
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>position: absolute;</h4>
    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>
    <p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves
        along with page scrolling.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.</p>
    <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
    <p><u>exp.</u> div class="relative" div class="absolute" div div</p>

    <div class="relative2">This div element has position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;
        </div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h4>position: sticky;</h4>
    <p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</p>

    <p>A sticky element toggle between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative
        until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>

    <p style="background-color: yellow;">You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.</p>
    <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position.
    </p>
    <p><u>exp.</u> div class="relative" div class="sticky" dive div class="padding-bottom: 100px;" div div </p>

    <div class="relative3" style="text-align: center;"><b>Try to scroll inside this frame to understand how sticky
            positioning works.</b>
        <div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
        <div style="padding-bottom: 200px;">
            <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll
                position.</p>
            <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>

    <h4>Overlapping Elements</h4>
    <p>When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.</p>
    <p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or
        behind, the others).</p>
    <p>An element can have a positive or negative stack order:</p>

    <div class="relative4">
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <img src="Eiffel.png" alt="Eiffel" width="100" height="150" style="opacity: 0.4;">
        <img src="Paris.jpg" alt="Paris" class="img2" width="400" height="150" style="opacity: 0.4;">
        <p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text. Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet
            consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
    </div>
    <p>An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the
        HTML code will be shown on top.</p>

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

### Basic JavaScript
- **Comment Your JavaScript Code**
    - There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript: 
        - Using `//` will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:<br><br>  
        > // This is an in-line comment.  
        - You can make a multi-line comment beginning with `/*` and ending with `*/`:<br><br>
        > /* This is a multi-line comment */
- **Declare JavaScript Variables**
    - JavaScript provides eight different data types which are
        - undefined
        - null
        - boolean
        - string
        - symbol
        - bigint
        - number
        - object
    - Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.<br><br>
    > var myName;

- **Storing Values with the Assignment Operator**
    - In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the *assignment* operator.<br><br>
    > myVariable = 5;
    
    This assigns the `Number` value `5` to `myVariable`.<br><br>
    Assignsment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the `=` operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.<br><br>
    > myVar = 5;<br>
    > myNum = myVar;
    
    This assigns `5` to `myVar` and then resolves `myVar` to `5` again and assigns it to `myNum`.

    - Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.
    - Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.<br><br>

    > a = 7;<br>b = a;

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

### Basic JavaScript
- Comment Your JavaScript Code
    - There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript: 
        - Using `//` will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:  


        > // This is an in-line comment.  


        - You can make a multi-line comment beginning with `/*` and ending with `*/`:

        > /* This is a multi-line comment */

- Declare JavaScript Variables
    - JavaScript provides eight different data types which are
        - undefined
        - null
        - boolean
        - string
        - symbol
        - bigint
        - number
        - object
